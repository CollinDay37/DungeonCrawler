DungeonCrawler

The DungeonCrawler has five main classes; Beings, Dungeon, Hero, Launcher, and Monster.
The goal of the game is make it through to the end of the room and kill anything that comes in your path. 
You will be able to tell what is in your path by these three symbols the Monster = 'M', the Hero = 'H', and null = '-'
While walking through the room if the hero comes into contact with '-' that means the space is empty and the hero will continue walking unharmed.
If the hero comes into contact with 'M' it must then fight the monster. 
If the hero doesn't win the fight it will die, if the hero does win it will keep walking but may lose some of it's health.
If you make it to the end of the room without dying you win the game!
