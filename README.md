# DungeonCrawler
The DungeonCrawler has 5 main classes; Beings, Dungeon, Hero, Launcher, and Monster.
The goal of the game is make it through to the end of the room and kill anything that comes in your path. 
We made the Monster = 'M', the Hero = 'H', and null = '_'
While walking through the room if the hero comes into contact with the monster it must then fight the monster.
If the hero wins the battle it will continue on through the room, but if the hero losses the battle it will lose
